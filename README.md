# Voice Recognition Biometric System

## Introduction

The **Voice Recognition Biometric System** is an AI-powered application that provides **secure authentication**, **real-time sentiment analysis**, and **personalized motivational quotes** based on voice input. This system leverages **Flask**, **Streamlit**, **MySQL**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and **scikit-learn** for advanced voice recognition and emotion detection.

## Features

- **Voice Authentication:** Secure access through voice biometrics.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Real-time emotion detection from voice input.
- **Personalized Quotes:** AI-driven motivational quotes tailored to detected emotions.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask, Streamlit
- **Frontend:** Streamlit UI
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn
- **NLP & Speech Processing:**Â NLTK, SpaCy, OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech API

## System Architecture

1. **Voice Input:** User speaks into a microphone.
2. **Voice Authentication:** System verifies identity using biometric voice patterns.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** AI model classifies emotion from speech.
4. **Quote Recommendation:** System selects and displays a relevant quote.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/voice-recognition-biometric.git](https://github.com/04bhavyaa/Voice-Recognition-Biometric-System)
   cd Voice-Recognition-Biometric-System
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Setup MySQL Database:**
   - Create a MySQL database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE voice_biometric;
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials:
     ```ini
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=root
     DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
     DB_NAME=voice_biometric
     ```
5. **Run Migrations (If Using Flask-Migrate):**
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```
6. **Start the Flask Backend:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
7. **Run Streamlit for UI (In a Separate Terminal):**
   ```bash
   streamlit run ui.py
   ```

## Usage

- **User Authentication:** Speak into the microphone to log in.
- **Emotion Detection:** The system will analyze your voice tone and classify emotions.
- **Personalized Quotes:** Based on detected sentiment, a motivational quote will be displayed.

will update

## Future Improvements

- Improve accuracy of voice authentication using deep learning models.
- Optimize NLP models for better sentiment analysis.
- Extend to support multiple languages for emotion detection.
